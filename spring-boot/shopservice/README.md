# ShopService

A sample Spring Boot RESTful API for validating integration with OJP(Open JDBC proxy).
The sample app is intended for managing a shop’s users, products, orders, order items, and product reviews.  
This project demonstrates a multi-entity, relational domain model with CRUD operations, integration testing, and a PostgreSQL (or H2 for tests) backend.

---

## Features

- **User Management** – Create, read, update, and delete users.
- **Product Management** – CRUD operations on products with price handling.
- **Order Management** – Place orders for users, containing multiple order items.
- **Order Item Management** – Manage order items associated with orders and products.
- **Product Review System** – Users can review products with ratings and comments.
- **RESTful API** – All features exposed via REST endpoints.
- **Integration Tests** – Each controller has comprehensive integration tests using MockMvc and H2 in-memory DB.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.2.x**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **PostgreSQL** (main DB, can be swapped for others)
- **H2** (in-memory DB for tests)
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **JUnit 5, MockMvc** (testing)

---

## Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.8+
- PostgreSQL (if running with real DB, not needed for tests)
- (Optional) Docker, Postman, etc.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd shopservice
```

### 2. Configure the database

Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` if you want to change the PostgreSQL connection (default assumes user and password as `postgres`):

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/shopdb
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Or use H2 for a quick start (see commented section in properties).

### 3. Build and run the application

This application is not intended to be run but instead to run validation tests using the OJP (Open JDBC Proxy). Still you should be able to run it as a service with below commands.

```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## API Overview

| Entity     | Endpoints (base path)     | Methods             |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Users      | `/users`                 | GET, POST           |
|            | `/users/{id}`            | GET, PUT, DELETE    |
| Products   | `/products`              | GET, POST           |
|            | `/products/{id}`         | GET, PUT, DELETE    |
| Orders     | `/orders`                | GET, POST           |
|            | `/orders/{id}`           | GET, PUT, DELETE    |
| OrderItems | `/orders/{orderId}/items`| GET, POST           |
|            | `/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}` | GET, PUT, DELETE |
| Reviews    | `/reviews`               | GET, POST           |
|            | `/reviews/{id}`          | GET, PUT, DELETE    |

All endpoints accept and return JSON.

## Running the Tests

Integration tests are provided for all controllers.  
**To run all tests, including integration tests, use:**

```sh
mvn clean verify
```

- This will build the project and execute all unit and integration tests.
- Integration tests use H2 in-memory database with test-specific properties (`src/test/resources/application-test.properties`).
- If you want to run only unit tests, use `mvn test` (not recommended for this project, as all tests are integration tests).
